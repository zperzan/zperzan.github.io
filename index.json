Over the coming decades, increased interannual variability in precipitation — wetter wet years and drier dry years — will place increased demand on our water infrastructure. Though we need additional water storage capacity to store water from rainy years for use during drought years, in many regions of the world water storage infrastructure is already maxed out. Flood managed aquifer recharge (flood-MAR) — an emerging technique in which working landscapes are flooded to replenish depleted aquifers — could meet this gap. However, identifying the most promising flood-MAR sites presents a challenge; many prospective sites are underlain by heterogeneous layers of sand and clay that can obstruct flow. In addition, the vadose zone beneath many flood-MAR sites can host a variety of contaminants, including fertilizers, salts and pesticide byproducts. A common conceptual model posits that initial flood-MAR operations will flush these contaminants to the saturated zone, degrading water quality, but in the long term, recharge operations will improve groundwater quality by diluting contaminant concentrations (Bachand et al., 2014).\nWe are combining high-resolution geophysical surveys with numerical modeling to understand the processes that control the flow of water and solutes during managed aquifer recharge. Future work will use machine learning surrogate models and airborne geophysical surveys to scale up our analyses from the site- to basin-scale. This work addresses a gap in our understanding of solute transport during extreme floods and provides actionable information to mitigate both flood damage and groundwater depletion.\nSimulated water content following a flood-MAR recharge event.

These models contain a wealth of domain knowledge about contaminant transport — the physics of water flow and the chemistry of water-rock interactions — but they are relatively fixed and not designed to handle new streams of incoming data; a calibrated reactive transport model, for example, has to be completely re-calibrated if new observations are not in agreement with model predictions.\nRecent advances in data science and in situ sensors — when combined with robust biogeochemical models — offer a unique opportunity to address this challenge.

To me, Hallmark holiday movies all have the same plot and same characters with different names, so I joked that a well-trained neural net could easily write one and no one would know the difference.1 That joke made me wonder how hard it would be to train an RNN to write movie scripts, so I set out to try.\nIt turns out scripts for movies on the Hallmark Channel are hard to find, so I decided to use screenplays written by Quentin Tarantino instead. I couldn’t find a usable copy of Grindhouse: Death Proof, but I got vector PDFs for everything else – 12 out of 13 isn’t bad.\nI converted the PDFs to text, cleaned up the text using a combination of sed and awk, embedded the characters as one-hot vectors, and fed that into a bidirectional LSTM. Words in all caps have special meaning in screenplays (names of characters, camera directions), so I embedded upper and lower case letters separately.\nThe finished model consists of 2 bidirectional LSTM layers – each with 512 nodes and 20% recurrent dropout – topped off by fully-connected Softmax layer with 82 nodes (there are 82 total characters in the model). The full details and all the code is available in the repo. For now, let’s see some sample output:\nA few observations:\nThe model is great at picking up on the general structure of a screenplay; characters exchange dialog and occasionally you get camera and scene instructions – “CU of Mickey” (ie, a close up shot of Mickey) and “INT. - BARTHOUSE - DAY” (ie, an interior shot at the “barthouse” during the day). Scenes are an amalgam of characters from all of Tarantino’s movies (“THE BRIDE” from Kill Bill, “ORDELL” from Jackie Brown, etc), but unsurprisingly it doesn’t create any new character names. It’s also pretty good at word completion (short-term memory). It completes “the burn on the side of his f” with “face” and “walking towards the hos” with “hostages”. I really like the “MAX … INT. - BARTHOUSE - DAY … MAX (CONT’D)” sequence, though I think that was coincidence more than anything. With an input sequence of 50 characters, the model could not have known that MAX was talking prior to the scene change. I didn’t fully tune the model because I felt bad wasting cluster resources on a silly task, but it achieves 60% accuracy on the test set. That’s pretty good considering the messy text and paucity of data (1.7M chars total). It trained relatively quickly as well (9 epochs with early stopping).\nUpdate 2019: I would be curious to see how well one of the “Sesame Street” models – ELMo, ERNIE, BERT, XLNet, RoBERTa, Transfo-XL, GPT-2, etc – would perform on the same task. Thomas Dehaene must have had the same thought regarding Hallmark movies, as he just posted this tutorial on his blog. He couldn’t find any screenplays either and used subtitles instead.\nI subsequently found this post from a comedian making the same point, though that script was clearly human-generated. ↩︎\n","date":1540425600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540425600,"objectID":"5a2f0e2333ac697096e9e7019341b8b1","permalink":"https://zperzan.github.io/projects/script-generator/","publishdate":"2018-10-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/script-generator/","section":"projects","summary":"Can a character-level recurrent neural net learn to write movie scripts?","tags":["Deep Learning","RNN","NLP","LSTM","Neural net"],"title":"Teaching an RNN to write movie scripts","type":"projects"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The ongoing water crisis in Flint, Michigan, was – and still is – a major news story that exposed governmental oversight and brought the question of safe drinking water into the news.

This is significantly older than any surface sediments in New England, which were all deposited after the last glacial maximum (~26 ka).1 We combined the Weybridge Cave record with other sedimentary records from the region to calculate rates of Laurentide Ice Sheet advance during the last glaciation.

Given the potential for partial bleaching and the fact that most samples were at or near saturation, New England cave sediemnts probably weren’t the easiest samples to start out with.2\nAs part of this project, I also collected a young stalactite and took it to the clean lab at the University of Quebec at Montreal for U-Th age dating. For his undergraduate thesis, Drew Gorin (another Middlebury geology student) then combined those ages with stable isotope measurements to construct a late Holocene precipitation and temperature record.3\nEstimates differ, but see Dyke et al. (2002), Mickelson and Colgan (2003) and Ridge (2004) for more info. ↩︎\nCounterintuitively, luminescence-based dating techniques are not well suited to cave sediments because of the high potential for partial bleaching; sediments deposited at the surface usually have direct exposure to sunlight, whereas sediments deposited in one chamber of a cave could be eroded and deposited in another chamber, without ever being exposed to light. In this way, luminescence ages on cave sediments represent the time they first entered the cave, not the time they were deposited in the sequence. ↩︎\nGorin, Andrew L., 2016.
