However, the vadose zone beneath many flood-MAR sites can host a variety of contaminants, including fertilizers, salts and pesticide byproducts. A common conceptual model posits that initial flood-MAR operations will flush these contaminants to the saturated zone, degrading water quality, but in the long term, recharge operations will improve groundwater quality by diluting contaminant concentrations (Bachand et al., 2014).

To me, Hallmark holiday movies all have the same plot and same characters with different names, so I joked that a well-trained neural net could easily write one and no one would know the difference.1 That joke made me wonder how hard it would be to train an RNN to write movie scripts, so I set out to try.\nIt turns out scripts for movies on the Hallmark Channel are hard to find, so I decided to use screenplays written by Quentin Tarantino instead. I couldn’t find a usable copy of Grindhouse: Death Proof, but I got vector PDFs for everything else – 12 out of 13 isn’t bad.\nI converted the PDFs to text, cleaned up the text using a combination of sed and awk, embedded the characters as one-hot vectors, and fed that into a bidirectional LSTM. Words in all caps have special meaning in screenplays (names of characters, camera directions), so I embedded upper and lower case letters separately.\nThe finished model consists of 2 bidirectional LSTM layers – each with 512 nodes and 20% recurrent dropout – topped off by fully-connected Softmax layer with 82 nodes (there are 82 total characters in the model). The full details and all the code is available in the repo. For now, let’s see some sample output:\nA few observations:\nThe model is great at picking up on the general structure of a screenplay; characters exchange dialog and occasionally you get camera and scene instructions – “CU of Mickey” (ie, a close up shot of Mickey) and “INT. - BARTHOUSE - DAY” (ie, an interior shot at the “barthouse” during the day). Scenes are an amalgam of characters from all of Tarantino’s movies (“THE BRIDE” from Kill Bill, “ORDELL” from Jackie Brown, etc), but unsurprisingly it doesn’t create any new character names. It’s also pretty good at word completion (short-term memory). It completes “the burn on the side of his f” with “face” and “walking towards the hos” with “hostages”. I really like the “MAX … INT. - BARTHOUSE - DAY … MAX (CONT’D)” sequence, though I think that was coincidence more than anything. With an input sequence of 50 characters, the model could not have known that MAX was talking prior to the scene change. I didn’t fully tune the model because I felt bad wasting cluster resources on a silly task, but it achieves 60% accuracy on the test set. That’s pretty good considering the messy text and paucity of data (1.7M chars total). It trained relatively quickly as well (9 epochs with early stopping).\nUpdate 2019: I would be curious to see how well one of the “Sesame Street” models – ELMo, ERNIE, BERT, XLNet, RoBERTa, Transfo-XL, GPT-2, etc – would perform on the same task. Thomas Dehaene must have had the same thought regarding Hallmark movies, as he just posted this tutorial on his blog. He couldn’t find any screenplays either and used subtitles instead.\nI subsequently found this post from a comedian making the same point, though that script was clearly human-generated. ↩︎\n","date":1540425600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540425600,"objectID":"5a2f0e2333ac697096e9e7019341b8b1","permalink":"https://zperzan.github.io/projects/script-generator/","publishdate":"2018-10-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/script-generator/","section":"projects","summary":"Can a character-level recurrent neural net learn to write movie scripts?","tags":["Deep Learning","RNN","NLP","LSTM","Neural net"],"title":"Teaching an RNN to write Movie Scripts","type":"projects"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The ongoing water crisis in Flint, Michigan, was – and still is – a major news story that exposed governmental oversight and brought the question of safe drinking water into the news.

This is significantly older than any surface sediments in New England, which were all deposited after the last glacial maximum (~26 ka).1 We combined the Weybridge Cave record with other sedimentary records from the region to calculate rates of Laurentide Ice Sheet advance during the last glaciation.

Given the potential for partial bleaching and the fact that most samples were at or near saturation, New England cave sediemnts probably weren’t the easiest samples to start out with.2\nAs part of this project, I also collected a young stalactite and took it to the clean lab at the University of Quebec at Montreal for U-Th age dating.

(2002), Mickelson and Colgan (2003) and Ridge (2004) for more info. ↩︎\nCounterintuitively, luminescence-based dating techniques are not well suited to cave sediments because of the high potential for partial bleaching; sediments deposited at the surface usually have direct exposure to sunlight, whereas sediments deposited in one chamber of a cave could be eroded and deposited in another chamber, without ever being exposed to light. In this way, luminescence ages on cave sediments represent the time they first entered the cave, not the time they were deposited in the sequence. ↩︎\nGorin, Andrew L., 2016.

Most of my time was spent driving around the desert, dodging rattlesnakes and exploring lava tube caves. In collaboration with researchers from Idaho State University, we used a tripod-mounted LiDAR system to map the interior of several caves.\nFull map of Maze Cave, viewed from the side. A single map consists of several (20-50) different individual scans from the LiDAR unit that are then merged together during post-processing. The BLM was interested in detailed cave maps for practical reasons – in case of a rescue, for example – as well as for basic research purposes. Precise cross-sections of lava tubes can be used to infer the velocity and viscocity of lava that once flowed through the caves, while a time series of LiDAR scans can be used to better understand cave wall deformation and cave collapse.\n","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"69710798f36f1b99b831ac11ea83d50e","permalink":"https://zperzan.github.io/projects/lidar-caves/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/lidar-caves/","section":"projects","summary":"We used ground-based LiDAR to map the interior of lava tube caves across Idaho's Snake River Plain.","tags":["Cave","Lidar"],"title":"Mapping lava tube caves with LiDAR","type":"projects"},{"authors":["","Robert Ford"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
