These models contain a wealth of domain knowledge about contaminant transport \u0026ndash; the physics of water flow and the chemistry of water-rock interactions \u0026ndash; but they are relatively fixed and not designed to handle new streams of incoming data; a calibrated reactive transport model, for example, has to be completely re-calibrated from the beginning if new observations are not in agreement with model predictions.\nRecent advances in data science and in situ sensor technology \u0026ndash; when combined with robust biogeochemical models \u0026ndash; offer a unique opportunity to address this challenge. We have installed a network of solar-powered environmental sensors at sites in Colorado and Wyoming that provide continuous, high-frequency measurements of hydrologic conditions, microbial metabolic activity and key biogeochemical constituents. Remote connection via cellular modem allows us to access this data and update models in real time.\nWe are using several techniques to combine the knowledge contained within (process-based) reactive transport models with the flexibility and adaptability of modern machine learning/deep learning models. This includes:\n Assimilating sensor data into a basic reactive transport model with an ensemble Kalman filter Training an LSTM (and now transformers) with data from reactive transport model simulations, then using transfer learning to apply the model to real-world data The same as above, but using sensor data from other sites across the world Augementing sensor training data with generative adverarial networks (GAN) then building a GRU, LSTM, or sequence-to-sequence model  ","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"c68ad7c924884f925661fd47d71dd7c3","permalink":"https://zperzan.github.io/research/sensors/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/sensors/","section":"research","summary":"Using real-time data from in situ sensors and recurrent neural nets (RNNs) to make predictions about groundwater quality.","tags":["Sensors","Deep learning","Kalman filter"],"title":"Data-driven water quality modeling","type":"research"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"A long history of uranium mining and weapons development throughout the Cold War has left many mining, milling and testing sites contaminated with radioactive materials like uranium, thorium, and radium, as well as other non-radioactive heavy metals including vanadium, molybdenum, selenium and arsenic.

A switch in the municipal drinking water supply, combined with insufficient water treatment, exposed over 100,000 Flint residents to elevated levels of coliform bacteria, lead and trihalomethans (THMs). Reporting on the crisis made national headlines and caused many Americans to reconsider the safety of their tap water. Even though the crisis affected a small, working-class city, we can see that bottled water sales spiked around the same time period in other states all across the country.\nWe are examining consumer spending habits and public sentiment data to analyze how many Americans distrust their tap and rely on bottled water as an alternate drinking water supply. Recent research has shown that U.S. households who perceive the tap as unsafe spend $5.65 billion per year on alternate water supplies1, despite the fact that bottled water is less regulated than tap water and isn\u0026rsquo;t any safer on average.\n Javidi, A., Pierce, G., 2018.

Though we need additional water storage capacity to store water from rainy years for use during drought years, events like the Oroville Dam disaster highlight the fact that California’s water storage infrastructure is already maxed out. Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) projects \u0026ndash; in which water is intentionally stored in aquifers for later extraction \u0026ndash; have been proposed as a tool to combat this problem; in California’s Central Valley, excess precipitation diverted to MAR sites could recharge aquifers with up to 1.5 km3 of water per year, approximately 11% of annual groundwater withdrawals.1\nHowever, identifying the most promising MAR sites remains an ongoing challenge.

We found a sequence of sediments in Weybridge Cave, Vermont, and used luminescence and paleomagnetic technqiues to show that the sediments span from 35 to 70 ka. This is significantly older than any surface sediments in New England, which were all deposited after the last glacial maximum (~26 ka).1 We combined the Weybridge Cave record with other sedimentary records from the region to calculate rates of Laurentide Ice Sheet advance during the last glaciation. Read the full details at:\nMunroe, J., Perzan, Z., and Amidon, W., 2016. Cave sediments constrain the latest Pleistocene advance of the Laurentide ice sheet in the Champlain Valley, Vermont, USA. Journal of Quaternary Science, 31 (8), pp. 893-904.\nDuring this research, I was lucky enough to be the first to use Middlebury\u0026rsquo;s new luminescence geochronology lab and spent many hours toiling away in the dark room figuring out our brand new instrument. Given the potential for partial bleaching and the fact that most samples were at or near saturation, New England cave sediemnts probably weren\u0026rsquo;t the easiest samples to start out with.2\nAs part of this project, I also collected a young stalactite and took it to the clean lab at the University of Quebec at Montreal for U-Th age dating. For his undergraduate thesis, Drew Gorin (another Middlebury geology student) then combined those ages with stable isotope measurements to construct a late Holocene precipitation and temperature record.3\n Estimates differ, but see Dyke et al. (2002), Mickelson and Colgan (2003) and Ridge (2004) for more info. ^ Counterintuitively, luminescence-based dating techniques are not well suited to cave sediments because of the high potential for partial bleaching; sediments deposited at the surface usually have direct exposure to sunlight, whereas sediments deposited in one chamber of a cave could be eroded and deposited in another chamber, without ever being exposed to light. In this way, luminescence ages on cave sediments represent the time they first entered the cave, not the time they were deposited in the sequence. ^ Gorin, Andrew L., 2016.

To me, Hallmark holiday movies all have the same plot and same characters with different names, so I joked that a well-trained neural net could easily write one and no one would know the difference.1 That joke made me wonder how hard it would be to train an RNN to write movie scripts, so I set out to try.\nIt turns out scripts for movies on the Hallmark Channel are hard to find, so I decided to use screenplays written by Quentin Tarantino instead. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a usable copy of Grindhouse: Death Proof, but I got vector PDFs for everything else \u0026ndash; 12 out of 13 isn\u0026rsquo;t bad.\nI converted the PDFs to text, cleaned up the text using a combination of sed and awk, embedded the characters as one-hot vectors, and fed that into a bidirectional LSTM. Words in all caps have special meaning in screenplays (names of characters, camera directions), so I embedded upper and lower case letters separately.\nThe finished model consists of 2 bidirectional LSTM layers \u0026ndash; each with 512 nodes and 20% recurrent dropout \u0026ndash; topped off by fully-connected Softmax layer with 82 nodes (there are 82 total characters in the model). The full details and all the code is available in the repo. For now, let\u0026rsquo;s see some sample output:\n         A few observations:\n The model is great at picking up on the general structure of a screenplay; characters exchange dialog and occasionally you get camera and scene instructions \u0026ndash; \u0026ldquo;CU of Mickey\u0026rdquo; (ie, a close up shot of Mickey) and \u0026ldquo;INT. - BARTHOUSE - DAY\u0026rdquo; (ie, an interior shot at the \u0026ldquo;barthouse\u0026rdquo; during the day). Scenes are an amalgam of characters from all of Tarantino\u0026rsquo;s movies (\u0026ldquo;THE BRIDE\u0026rdquo; from Kill Bill, \u0026ldquo;ORDELL\u0026rdquo; from Jackie Brown, etc), but unsurprisingly it doesn\u0026rsquo;t create any new character names. It\u0026rsquo;s also pretty good at word completion (short-term memory). It completes \u0026ldquo;the burn on the side of his f\u0026rdquo; with \u0026ldquo;face\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;walking towards the hos\u0026rdquo; with \u0026ldquo;hostages\u0026rdquo;. I really like the \u0026ldquo;MAX \u0026hellip; INT. - BARTHOUSE - DAY \u0026hellip; MAX (CONT\u0026rsquo;D)\u0026rdquo; sequence, though I think that was coincidence more than anything. With an input sequence of 50 characters, the model could not have known that MAX was talking prior to the scene change.  I didn\u0026rsquo;t fully tune the model because I felt bad wasting cluster resources on a silly task, but it achieves 60% accuracy on the test set. That\u0026rsquo;s pretty good considering the messy text and paucity of data (1.7M chars total). It trained relatively quickly as well (9 epochs with early stopping).\nUpdate 2019: I would be curious to see how well one of the \u0026ldquo;Sesame Street\u0026rdquo; models \u0026ndash; ELMo, ERNIE, BERT, XLNet, RoBERTa, Transfo-XL, GPT-2, etc \u0026ndash; would perform on the same task. Thomas Dehaene must have had the same thought regarding Hallmark movies, as he just posted this tutorial on his blog. He couldn\u0026rsquo;t find any screenplays either and used subtitles instead.\n I subsequently found this post from a comedian making the same point, though that script was clearly human-generated. ^   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"5a2f0e2333ac697096e9e7019341b8b1","permalink":"https://zperzan.github.io/projects/script-generator/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/script-generator/","section":"projects","summary":"Can a character-level recurrent neural net learn to write movie scripts?","tags":["Deep Learning","RNN","NLP","LSTM","Neural net"],"title":"Teaching an RNN to write Movie Scripts","type":"projects"}]
